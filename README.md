# Project Name

This project aims to demonstrate the integration of ONNX, TorchServe, and DVC for efficient model deployment and version control.

## Overview

The project leverages the power of ONNX, an open format for representing machine learning models, to export trained models from popular frameworks like PyTorch. These ONNX models can then be deployed using TorchServe, a flexible and scalable model serving library. Additionally, DVC (Data Version Control) is used to manage the versioning and tracking of both the model files and the associated data.

## Features

- Export trained models to ONNX format using PyTorch
- Deploy ONNX models using TorchServe for efficient model serving
- Utilize DVC for version control and tracking of model files and data
